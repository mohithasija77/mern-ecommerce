#Create a .env file in the backend directory.
Add the following variables with appropriate values
# Database connection string
MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name"

# Frontend URL (adjust if needed)
ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000"

Frontend

Create a .env file in the frontend directory
Add the following variable:
# Backend URL (adjust if needed)
REACT_APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000" 
Important

Replace all placeholders (e.g., your_database_name, your_email) with your actual values.
Exclude the .env file from version control to protect sensitive information.
Data seeding
Get started quickly with pre-populated data: Populate your database with sample users, products, reviews, and carts, enabling you to test functionalities without manual data entry.
Steps:

Open a new terminal window.
Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend
Run the seeding script: npm run seed ( This script executes the seed.js file within the seed subdirectory equivalent to running node seed/seed.js )
Running Development Servers
Important:

Separate terminals: Run the commands in separate terminal windows or use split terminal to avoid conflicts.
Nodemon required: Ensure you have nodemon installed globally to run the backend development servers using npm run dev. You can install it globally using npm install -g nodemon.
Start the backend server
Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend

Start the server: 
```bash
npm run dev (or npm start)
```
You should see a message indicating the server is running, usually on port 8000.
Start the frontend server:
Navigate to the frontend directory: 
```bash
cd frontend
Start the server: npm start
```
You should see a message indicating the server is running, usually on port 3000.
Login with demo account (Optional)

After successfully seeding the database, you can now explore the application's functionalities using pre-populated sample data.
here are the login credentials
```bash
  email: demo@gmail.com
  pass: helloWorld@123

```
Please Note: While the demo account provides a convenient way to explore many features, it has some limitations:

Password Reset and OTP Verification: Due to security reasons, the demo account uses a non-real email address. Therefore, password reset and OTP verification functionalities are not available for this account.
What this means:

You cannot request a password reset or receive verification codes on the demo email address.
To test password reset and OTP verification flows, you need to create a genuine account with a valid email address.
What to do?

If you're primarily interested in exploring other functionalities like wishlist, cart, and order history, the demo account is sufficient.
To test password reset and OTP verification, create a personal account with a valid email address.
Accessing the Application
